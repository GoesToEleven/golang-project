Family friends and other connections with people give us purpose. The purpose comes from knowing 
how you can contribute to the well-being of those you connect with and empathise with. Helping a
child, or someone that is unable to help themselves is more a part of our own well-being as part
of humanity. It is difficult to feel truely satisfied with prosperity or success if those you 
care about are suffering and this extends to all in our reach. Of course no one person can save
the world but we each know what is truely in our power to change and contribute.
